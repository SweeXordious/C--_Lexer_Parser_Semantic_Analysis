# C--_Lexer_Parser_Semantic_Analysis
This repo contains the code of a compilation project that intends to make a lexical analyzer, parser, sematic analyzer for a certain language close to C++. 

The rapport contains all the necessary informations about the project : the grammar, the functions, the automats, etc ... Its in French but contains lot of self explanatory images for any student who is working on a similar project.

Have Fun exploring it ;)
